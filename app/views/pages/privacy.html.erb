You can configure  your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you  when a cookie is set.

<strong>Information  Sharing and Disclosure</strong><br /><br />
When  you post a message or comment, your SidelineSwap ID or alias is  visible to other users. If you post personal information online that  is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages  from other parties in return. SidelineSwap may be required to  disclose personally identifiable information under special  circumstances, such as to comply with subpoenas or when your actions  violate the SidelineSwap Terms of Use. SidelineSwap may disclose  personally identifiable information to parties in compliance with  SidelineSwap's Copyright and Intellectual Property Policy, as  SidelineSwap in SidelineSwap's sole discretion believes necessary  or appropriate in connection with an investigation of fraud,  intellectual property infringement, piracy, or other unlawful  activity. In such events, SidelineSwap may disclose name, street  address, city, state, zip code, country, phone number, email address  and company name. SidelineSwap may share aggregated demographic  information with business partners.<br /><br />
SidelineSwap  employs other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and  needs to share your information with them to provide products and  services to you. Examples include but are not limited to fulfilling  orders, handling billing disputes and collections, analyzing data,  providing marketing assistance and providing customer service.<br /><br />
SidelineSwap  will not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with  nonaffiliated parties except as specified in this Privacy Policy to  provide products or services you have requested or when SidelineSwap  has your permission. It may be necessary to share information in  order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal  activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats  to the physical safety of any person, violations of SidelineSwap's  Terms of Use, as specified in this Privacy Policy or as otherwise  required by law. In some cases, SidelineSwap may choose to buy or  sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer information is  typically one of the business assets that is transferred.  SidelineSwap will transfer information about you if SidelineSwap is  acquired by or merged with another company. In this event,  SidelineSwap will notify you by email or by putting a prominent  notice on the SidelineSwap web site before information about you is  transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.<br /><br />
As  part of the buying and selling process, you may obtain another  SidelineSwap user's email address, shipping address and/or other  information. Pursuant to SidelineSwap's Terms of Use, you have a  limited license to use this information. This information should only  be used for SidelineSwap-related communications or for  SidelineSwap-facilitated transactions. SidelineSwap has not granted  you a license to use the information for unsolicited commercial  messages. Without limiting the foregoing, without express consent  from the user, you are not licensed to add any SidelineSwap user to  your email or physical mail list.<br /><br />
Without  limiting the above, in an effort to respect your privacy and  SidelineSwap's ability to keep the community free from bad actors,  SidelineSwap will not otherwise disclose your personal information to  law enforcement, other government officials, or other third parties  without a subpoena, court order, legal process, or substantially  similar legal procedure, except when SidelineSwap believes in good  faith that the disclosure of information is necessary to protect  SidelineSwap's rights, prevent imminent physical harm or financial  loss, or to report suspected illegal activity.<br /><br />
<strong>Third  Parties</strong><br /><br />
Except  as otherwise expressly included in this Privacy Policy, this document  addresses only the use and disclosure of information SidelineSwap  collects from you. If you disclose your information to others,  whether they are buyers or sellers on SidelineSwap or throughout the  internet, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the  information you disclose to them. SidelineSwap does not control the  privacy policies of third parties, and you are subject to the privacy  policies of those third parties where applicable. SidelineSwap is not  responsible for the privacy or security practices of other websites  on the Internet, even those linked to or from the SidelineSwap's  site.
